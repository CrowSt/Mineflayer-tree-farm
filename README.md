bot farms trees on a tree farm

the bot designed to work on this farm: https://youtu.be/KNs2Aqn5aro?si=_wvkYr73otYihZvm
there's a world download in description

The bot disables the farm if it has neither saplings or bone meal in its inventory! <br>
The bot enables the farm, if it has both of them! Awesome! 

I wanted to use this bot on 2b2t, bot the bot can't connect to the server! <br>
By the way, it can't work with ZenithProxy. At least it can connect to it... 

Exception:
`Chunk size is 75 but only 1 was read ; partial packet : {"name":123}; buffer : blah blah long data`
